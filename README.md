# MDS Capstone - Predicting Floods in Canadian Rivers

I completed my [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) capstone project with my team at the University of British Columbia in May-June 2023, in partnership with [BGC Engineering Inc.](https://www.bgcengineering.ca/) in Vancouver, BC. 

### Project Summary

Existing methods for flood magnitude prediction have not been updated to keep pace with modern statistical techniques and may provide less reliable estimations of flood magnitude. As machine learning becomes more sophisticated, it has become clear that traditional flood estimation methods could benefit from integrating these modern machine learning and statistical techniques.

In this project, we used modern machine learning and statistical techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of traditionally used practices for predicting flood magnitudes in Canadian rivers. 

We pursued two main approaches to complete this objective: the Index Flood Method (IFM) and Direct Quantile Method (DQM). In the IFM, we combined unsupervised clustering, supervised ML predictions of the index flood, and statistical distribution fitting to predict high river flow quantiles. In the DQM, we used supervised ML quantile regression models to predict high-flow quantiles directly. 

In both approaches, our models successfully demonstrated an improvement in the accuracy and efficiency of predictions when compared to the results of currently used methodologies.

Two primary deliverables were presented by our team to BGC Engineering:
- A GitLab repository containing a Python script that generates river flow quantile predictions using our trained models, as well as supporting analyses collected in Jupyter Notebooks.
- A report documentation of our project motivation, workflow and justification of transitioning from traditional flood prediction practices to our new methodologies.

Our work has promising potential for advancing flood prediction technologies used by engineers and hydrologists, ultimately improving infrastructural decision-making.
